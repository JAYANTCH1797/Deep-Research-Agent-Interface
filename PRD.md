# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
**Deep Research Agent Interface**

## Overview
The Deep Research Agent Interface is an AI-powered research assistant that leverages LangGraph to conduct comprehensive, multi-step research on any topic. It provides users with a clean, modern interface to submit research queries, view real-time progress, and receive well-structured, cited answers. The system emphasizes transparency by streaming intermediate steps and decisions made by the agent.

## Goals & Objectives

- Enable users to submit complex research questions and receive high-quality, well-cited answers.
- Provide real-time visibility into the research process, including intermediate steps and agent reasoning.
- Deliver a modern, intuitive, and accessible user interface.
- Ensure reliability, responsiveness, and graceful error handling.

## Key Features

1. **Query Submission**
   - Users can enter research questions in a prominent, easy-to-use input field.
   - Support for both simple and complex queries.

2. **Clean, Modern Interface**
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
   - Clear separation between input, progress, and results.
   - Dark/light mode support.

3. **Real-Time Event Streaming**
   - Users can observe the agent’s workflow in real time (e.g., query generation, web search, aggregation, reflection, answer synthesis).
   - Visual timeline or activity feed for each research phase.
   - Debug panel for advanced users to inspect raw event data.

4. **Comprehensive Results**
   - Final answers are well-structured, use markdown formatting, and include proper citations.
   - Sources are clearly listed and accessible.

5. **Error Handling & Feedback**
   - User-friendly error messages.
   - Fallback/demo mode if backend is unavailable.

## User Stories

### 1. Entering Queries

**As a user, I want to enter my research question into a clear input field, so that I can easily start a new research session.**

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - There is a prominent input box labeled for research questions.
  - Submitting a query triggers the research process and disables the input until results are ready or the process is cancelled.

---

### 2. Receiving Clean Responses

**As a user, I want to see the answer to my research question displayed in a clean, readable format, so that I can quickly understand the results and access cited sources.**

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - The answer is shown in a dedicated results panel.
  - The answer uses markdown formatting (headings, lists, links).
  - All sources are cited and clickable.
  - The interface is free of clutter and distractions.

---

### 3. Seeing Intermediate Process (Event Stream)

**As a user, I want to watch the research agent’s progress in real time, so that I can understand how the answer is being generated and trust the process.**

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - A timeline or activity feed shows each phase (e.g., Query Generation, Web Search, Aggregation, Reflection, Answer Generation).
  - Each event (start, complete, progress) is displayed as it happens.
  - Users can expand steps to see details (e.g., generated queries, search results, reflection notes).
  - Advanced users can open a debug panel to view raw event data.

---

### 4. Error Handling

**As a user, I want to be notified if something goes wrong, so that I know what happened and what to do next.**

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Errors are displayed in a clear, non-intrusive way.
  - Suggestions or fallback options are provided (e.g., retry, demo mode).

---

### 5. Accessibility & Theming

**As a user, I want the interface to be accessible and match my system’s theme, so that it’s comfortable to use in any environment.**

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Supports keyboard navigation and screen readers.
  - Dark/light mode toggles automatically or manually.
  - High contrast and readable fonts.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Research sessions should begin within 2 seconds of query submission; intermediate events should stream with minimal latency.
- **Reliability:** The system should handle backend failures gracefully and provide fallback/demo mode.
- **Security:** No user data is stored without consent; all API endpoints are protected from abuse.
- **Scalability:** The backend can handle multiple concurrent research sessions.

---

## Out of Scope

- User authentication and persistent user accounts (for initial release).
- Support for file uploads or non-textual queries.
- Customization of research workflow by end-users.

---

## Success Metrics

- 95% of research sessions complete without error.
- Average time to first event < 2 seconds.
- >90% positive feedback on interface clarity and usability.
