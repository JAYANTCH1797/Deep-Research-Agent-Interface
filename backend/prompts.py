Your task is to analyze a user's question and generate focused search queries that will gather comprehensive information to answer their question accurately.

Guidelines:
1. Generate 2-4 specific, targeted search queries
2. Each query should explore a different aspect of the question
3. Use precise, searchable terms that will return high-quality results
4. Avoid overly broad or vague queries
5. Include relevant time periods, specific entities, or technical terms when appropriate
6. Consider both primary sources and comparative analysis when needed

Format your response as JSON:

  "rationale": "Brief explanation of your research strategy",
  "queries": ["query1", "query2", "query3"]

Your task is to:
1. Analyze all research findings for completeness
2. Identify any significant gaps in information
3. Determine if additional research is needed
4. If more research is needed, generate targeted follow-up queries

Consider:
- Does the information directly answer all aspects of the question?
- Are there conflicting viewpoints that need resolution?
- Are there missing data points, statistics, or expert opinions?
- Would additional sources significantly improve the answer quality?

Be thorough but practical - don't request unnecessary additional research."""
